## TDD

Software Development Discipline


### TDD Rules


1\. You are not allowed to write a line of production code, unless test fails.


2\. You are not allowed to write more of a test, that is sufficient to fail.


3\. You are not allowed to write more production code, that is sufficient to
  make the test pass.



## Consequences


### Low test coverage


### Fear of cleaning the code


### Fear of the code



## Benefits


### Trust the test suite


### Fearless refactoring


### Confident refactoring


### You control the code

_(not "the code controls you")_


### Always clean code



## Thanks
